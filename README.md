# üß† Logo Similarity
**Logo Similarity** is a fast and scalable pipeline that takes logos from a `.parquet` file and clusters them based on visual similarity using OpenAI‚Äôs CLIP model. The project focuses on performance, clarity, and rich visual output ‚Äî making it ideal for brand tracking, competitive analysis, or large-scale logo classification.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project extracts logos from a structured dataset and groups similar ones together using state-of-the-art AI techniques.

Built in Python with an intuitive, modular design, this project offers:

- Logo extraction from `.snappy.parquet`
- Embedding generation using OpenAI's CLIP
- Dimensionality reduction (UMAP)
- Heatmaps and visualizations for interpretability
- Folder-based output for inspection
- CSV and image-based export of results

## ‚öîÔ∏è The Struggle

This project started with one of the most challenging tasks I‚Äôve encountered so far: **extracting and classifying logos from hundreds of websites**. It wasn‚Äôt just about coding ‚Äî it was about solving real-world messiness, inconsistencies, and unpredictability.

### üîç Logo Extraction Challenges

**Logo extraction was extremely difficult.** Websites were built differently, logos were stored in various formats, hidden behind lazy loading or inside CSS, and rarely named intuitively. I had to iterate, debug, and rework my extraction logic multiple times to get consistent results. I explored multiple scraping techniques, including using **max_workers** for parallel processing to scrape multiple sites faster, but even that didn't fully solve the issue ‚Äî there were still a lot of edge cases I had to handle, and performance optimization was crucial.

### üßº Classification Challenges

**Classification was another major hurdle.** Initially, I tried traditional image comparison techniques like **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**. However, it turned out to be **too slow**, especially when working with large datasets. Despite trying to optimize it with various configurations, SSIM wasn‚Äôt capable of handling the volume efficiently. Moreover, visually similar logos that were drastically different pixel-wise still had high SSIM scores. 

This is when I decided to pivot to more advanced methods:

üí° **CLIP, Dimensionality Reduction** ‚Äî After extensive research, I turned to **CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training)**, which allowed me to get vector representations of logos. However, even with CLIP, the journey wasn‚Äôt smooth. It required fine-tuning, experimenting with dimensionality reduction techniques (like PCA and UMAP). This approach worked significantly better, capturing the true essence of similarity between logos even when their appearances were quite different.

This wasn‚Äôt just a coding challenge ‚Äî it was a **deep learning experience** in handling complex datasets, thinking like a problem solver, and pushing through technical roadblocks.
